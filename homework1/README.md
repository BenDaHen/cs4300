Task 1

    Task 1 outputs the string "Hello World!" to the terminal, and the pytest checks to make sure that the output matches what was printed in the task. 

Task 2 

    Task 2 defines four functions that define two variables of types integer, float, string, and boolean, and then returns the sum of the two values. These return values are then checked for their expected values in four pytests. 

Task 3

    Task 3 has three separate functions: one to find if a number is positive or negative, one to find the first 10 prime numbers, and one to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 100. 

    The first function determines if a number is positive or negative by testing if it is greater or less than zero. The Pytest uses a positive number, negative number, and zero as test cases

    The second function determines the first 10 prime numbers by using flags and the modulo to get the first 4 prime numbers below 10. Then, it checks against all 4 modulos of the prime numbers below 10 to get the prime numbers above 10. The Pytest checks to make sure all 10 prime numbers are printed. 

    The third function determines the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a while loop with an incrementing total. The pytest checks to make sure the total is correct. 

Task 4

    Task 4 has a function that calculates the new price of something given the original price and the discount percentage. The pytest checks to make sure that the new discount is correctly calculated. 

Task 5

    Task 5 has a function that creates a list of books, and then uses slicing to get the first 3 entries of the list. The pytest checks to make sure that these 3 entries are returned. 

    The second function in task 5 creates a dictionary to represent a student registry, and the pytest checks to make sure that the dictionary is correct. 

Task 6

    Task 6 has a function that determines the number of words in a file by splitting the file into individual words after reading it. A word count is updated for every word that is split off. The pytest checks to make sure that the correct word count was found.
